# U.S_diabetes_prevalence_2019-2022_SQL_cleaned
The uncleaned data was comprised of data from  various healthcare studies. I decided to focus on diabetes since my first Ph.D. project [which was not much of a success], focused on diabetic foot ulcers. I used PostgreSQL to isolate and clean the raw data specifically for the prevalence of diabetes in the US. I wanted to focus on state-level and yearly trends. 


The raw data from various studies can be found at [https://www.cdc.gov/cdi/index.html]. I then used the cleaned data to formulate a yearly-filtered map dashboard in Tabelau. See the link in my bio for the results! :)
