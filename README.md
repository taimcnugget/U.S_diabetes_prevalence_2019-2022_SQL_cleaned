# U.S_diabetes_prevalence_2019-2022_SQL_cleaned
Cleaned data from the U.S Chronic Disease Indicator [CDC - https://www.cdc.gov/cdi/index.html] website. I isolated data specifically for overall United States diabetes studies and used Postgre SQL to clean the data to present trends on year and state level trends.
